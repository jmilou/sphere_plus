# sphere_plus
 
 - photon_sharing_tradeoff.ipynb is a python notebook to investigate the limiting magnitude in different scenarios of photon sharing between the science and the pyramid WFS. 
 
 - plot_J_vs_G_vs Strehl.ipynb  is a python notebook that reads a catalogue of young red stars in young associations (from C. Ginski) with corresponding magnitude in various filters (V, R, G, Y, J, H and K) and plot them in a color diagram along with the performance currently achieved by SPHERE for these stars. The goal is to overplot the expected performance of SPHERE+ in each of the scenarios of photon sharing. 
 
- main_simaccplanets_sphereplus.py and noise_model_hlines.py is a simulator to predict the S/N on medRES (worksheet from Rafaele Gratton converted in Python by Mickael Bonnefoy)
